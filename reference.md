## Glossary

{:auto_ids}
blocking
:    Samples of similar structure grouped together from both treatment and control.

biological replicate
:   Measurements of biologically distinct samples taken at the same time and place. Biological replicates capture random biological variation,
    which may itself be a subject of study or a source of noise.

block
:

confounder
: a difference between the treatment and control groups that is not the same as the treatment. A third variable that is associated with the explanatory (independent) and response (dependent) variables.

control
: an experimental subject that does not receive the treatment

controlled experiment
: an experiment done in parallel on a treatment and a control group that differ in one way (the independent or explanatory variable). Investigators determine which subjects go in the treatment group and which in the control group.

experimental error
:

experimental unit
:

factorial design
:   A design that permits testing of multiple variables at once.

fixed effects
:

observational study
: an experiment done in parallel on a treatment (or exposure) and a control group that differ in one way (the independent or explanatory variable). The subjects, not the investigators, determine whether they are in the treatment group or the control group (i.e. smokers and non-smokers).

random effects
:

random error
:

randomization
:    A method to reduce bias and minimize the likelihood of chance altering the results of an experiment.

replicability
:   Other researchers obtain corroborating results using experimental methods similar to those of the original study,
    generating their own data independently.

reproducibility
:   Other researchers duplicate results and can draw the same conclusions as the original study did using
    the same materials and methods (i.e. specific measurement devices, original data, software, statistical method).

systematic error
:

technical replicate
:   Repeated measurements of the same sample that represent independent measures of the random noise
    associated with protocols or equipment.

treatment
:
