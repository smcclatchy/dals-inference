## Glossary

{:auto_ids}
blocking
:   samples of similar structure grouped together from both treatment and control
biological replicate
:   parallel measurements of biologically distinct samples that capture random biological variation, which may itself be a subject of study or a source of noise.
factorial design
:   a design that permits testing of multiple variables at once
randomization
:    method to reduce bias and minimize the likelihood of chance altering the results of an experiment
replicability
:   Other scientists start with the same idea and use their own data and methods to produce the same result.
reproducibility
:   Other scientists use the same methods to obtain similar results and can draw the same conclusions. This might also mean that computer code and data are available so that others can redo the same analysis using the same data.
technical replicate
:   repeated measurements of the same sample that represent independent measures of the random noise associated with protocols or equipment.
