The goal of science is to build knowledge and understanding through an iterative process of 
most publishers and funding agencies now require
a series of reproducibility guidelines to be
satisfied for acceptable research.
JOHN QUACKENBUSH: For example, the Nature journals
require that manuscripts be submitted with a checklist linking
figures to data, statistics to methodology,
and data to accessible repositories and originating specimens
and the assays that were conducted.
The National Institutes of Health has reproducibility guidelines
for funding recipients and trainees.
These range from how you perform your statistics, to how you share your data,
and the software that you use to do the data analysis.
But ultimately, your data and your conclusions
are going to influence others, and in health and biomedical research,
that may actually include influencing the practice of clinical care.
So we want to make sure we do things right, and we want to make sure
that our results can be reproduced by ourselves and others.
JOHN QUACKENBUSH: Both Curtis and I work in biomedical research.
Most of our participants and other instructors in this course
work in biomedical research.
So we may draw too many examples from biomedical research.
But what we hope you get out of this is a real idea about the principles.
We want you to understand the principles and the tools that we can use.
And many of these tools are very easily generalizable to other fields.
And the principles are universal.

JOHN QUACKENBUSH: Curtis and I wanted to really just
have a conversation about why reproducibility is so important.
The scientific method requires that our work
can be falsified or verified by others.
CURTIS HUTTENHOWER: And I would think of reproducibility
as exactly that process.
If doing science means discovering something new about the universe
it's presumably true at any point in time and in anybody's hands.
And that doesn't just need reproducibility,
that is reproducibility.
JOHN QUACKENBUSH: Well earlier on, we talked
about data analysis and reproducibility really being an end to end process.
And it's interesting, as we've thought about doing experiments we've actually
incorporated principles from software design
into the design process of the experiment.
If we develop software, we think, well, how
is someone going to use that software?
When we do an experiment or start to design an experiment,
we think, well, how is someone going to use that data?
CURTIS HUTTENHOWER: Or how might somebody try to reproduce it.
Exactly.
I'm going to introduce computational tools for reproducible research.
We are going to explore three aspects.
First, reproducibility and code.
Then, reproducibility and data.
And finally, reproducibility and document generation.
