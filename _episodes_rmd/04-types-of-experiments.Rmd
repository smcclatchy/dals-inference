## Types of controlled experiments
 
### Pilot
### Exploratory
 hypothesis generation 

### Confirmatory
 hypothesis testing
 
## Observational experiments

## Experimental units

### Technical versus Biological Replicates


> ## Challenge 1
> You are attempting to get different red blood cell counts from a mouse, and you have enough blood   to measure 3 times through the machine. How many   replicates would this be, and of what type?  
a. 3 biological replicates  
b. 3 technical replicates  
c. 1 biological replicate  
d. 1 technical replicate  
e. b and c
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1
> > e. One mouse means that n=1, thus 1 biological replicate. Three runs through the machine means 3 technical replicates. This would be a good way to measure variation in the instrument, but not to infer anything about mice. An n of 1 does not lead to generalizable findings.

> ## Challenge 2
> If I want to know about mean blood glucose, should I     
> a. measure 1 mouse 9 times  
> b. 3 mice 3 times each  
> c. 9 mice 1 time each  
>
> > 
> > ## Solution to Challenge 2
> > c. 9 mice 1 time each so that you get a sense of the sample mean, the most precise estimate
