Before we go any further, we should clarify what we mean by “experiment,” and how we’ll be using the term in the rest of the course. Fry (2014) notes that “a hypothesis is formulated in the basis of observation or theory and tested by experiment” (p. 460). There are two important clauses in this sentence, each referring to a different kind of methodological approach. Let’s unpack this.

### A hypothesis is formulated on the basis of observation and theory 

Some procedures may be regarded as experimental in the sense that they involve investigating a matter that is to some extent unknown but do not have the purpose of testing a hypothesis. Examples are the recording of growth curves and organ weights in a novel strain as well as many observational or correlation studies. In what might be termed “exploratory experiments,” the primary objective is to generate information on which to build a hypothesis or look for patterns, and some definitions of the scientific method include this as a stage in the process. In “pilot experiments,” the intention is to provide preliminary information that can improve the conduct, quality, and efficiency of subsequent hypothesis-testing experiments, typically using small numbers of experimental units. (Fry, 2014, p. 460, reprinted with permission)

### A hypothesis is tested by experiment

Exploratory experiments and pilot studies are intended to study the relationships between variables, or test the feasibility of a research method and/or intervention. These studies do not necessarily employ the strict procedures and multiple study arms seen in a randomized controlled trial. Instead, exploratory experiments and pilot studies are meant to generate new questions and hypotheses that can then be tested under more prescribed experimental conditions on a larger scale (Thabane et al, 2010).

Biological experiments are typically comparative in nature and test the “null hypothesis,” which postulates no difference between sets of biological material treated the same except for the matter in question, and that testing involves accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis with a certain level of confidence. 
The outcome of the experiment provides evidence about the hypothesis tested, and the amount of confidence that can be placed in the correctness of the hypothesis is dependent on the strength of that evidence and the quality of the experimentation and not on whether the results meet any arbitrary cut-off level of significance or have been published in a high-impact journal. (Fry, p. 460, reprinted with permission)

Include some examples of experiments here? Are there good examples from JAX about exploratory or pilot studies that informed subsequent experimental designs?
Here’s an example of an exploratory metagenomics study that led to the identification of the proteorhodopsin gene, which led to new questions about bacterial evolution: http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3985/1/EE_proteorhodopsin_preprint.pdf  This article has a nice table comparing theory-driven and exploratory experiments, though we may not want to go down that path.

The remainder of this course will address the features of experimental design, including experimental units, randomization, replication, and control.

## Observational experiments

> ## Discussion
> Identify the type of experiment in each of the following.
> After identifying the type of experiment, describe a next possible step. 
> What hypotheses might the experiment generate or test?
> Which types of experiments have you performed?
1. example 1  
2. example 2  
3. example 3

> ## Discussion
> If you have mainly done exploratory or pilot studies, how have or how might those studies inform experimental designs? 
> If you have worked on experimental studies, how has that research been based on prior exploratory or pilot work?
> Reflect on key differences you see in study features.

## Experimental units

### Technical versus Biological Replicates


> ## Challenge 1
> You are attempting to get different red blood cell counts from a mouse, and you have enough blood   to measure 3 times through the machine. How many   replicates would this be, and of what type?  
a. 3 biological replicates  
b. 3 technical replicates  
c. 1 biological replicate  
d. 1 technical replicate  
e. b and c
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1
> > e. One mouse means that n=1, thus 1 biological replicate. Three runs through the machine means 3 technical replicates. This would be a good way to measure variation in the instrument, but not to infer anything about mice. An n of 1 does not lead to generalizable findings.

> ## Challenge 2
> If I want to know about mean blood glucose, should I     
> a. measure 1 mouse 9 times  
> b. 3 mice 3 times each  
> c. 9 mice 1 time each  
>

> > ## Solution to Challenge 2
> > c. 9 mice 1 time each so that you get a sense of the sample mean, the most precise estimate
