> ## Challenge 1
> Use this subset of data containing 20 males and 20 females and
> their baseline body weights to randomize to two different diets: high fat and regular chow.
> 1). Perform a complete randomization.  
> 2). Perform a balanced randomization. 
> 3). Check the sex ratio and difference in body weights.
> 4). Share the mean body weight for each group on the course etherpad.
