Science aims to construct knowledge that is reliable and robust, and that provides a stable foundation for building new knowledge. Science self-corrects when the scientific community actively engages in examining and appraising ideas. In order to critically evaluate the evidence behind ideas, the scientific community replicates investigations independently or reproduces experimental results using identical materials and methods. Replication requires detail of experimental methods, and reproduction requires availability of original data and software.

In order to promote reproducibility, most publishers and funding organizations require detailed experimental protocols and access to data or software so that members of the scientific community can re-analyze the study. When designing a study, looking forward toward how the scientific community will use the resulting data is wise. This is especially important for high profile studies or those with surprising results, since these are most likely to be deeply scrutinized by the scientific community.

The design of a study suggests its analysis. Knowing how a design can be analyzed is critical before embarking on experimentation. A quote from Sir Ronald Fisher states: "To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of." In fact, the design of a study in many ways is more important than its analysis. Analysis can always be re-worked or re-done; the original study however, would be costly and difficult to repeat if done badly.
